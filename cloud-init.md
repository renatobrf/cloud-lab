<p>Cloud-init is an open-source tool used to automate the initialization of virtual machines and cloud instances during the first boot. It takes configuration data, such as user-data and meta-data files (often in YAML format), to perform tasks like setting the hostname, installing packages, configuring users, and running scripts, which allows for repeatable and efficient infrastructure provisioning</p>
